The user should be able to input a temperature value in one scale and select the scale to convert to.
The program should display the converted temperature value to the user.
The program should handle invalid input and provide error messages accordingly.
Technical Requirements

The program should be implemented in C++.
The program should use functions to perform the temperature conversions.
The program should use if-else statements or switch statements to determine which conversion function to call based on the user's input.
The program should use input validation to ensure that the user's input is valid.
Goals

Create a functional temperature conversion program that can convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
Implement a user-friendly interface that allows the user to input a temperature value and select the scale to convert to.
Provide accurate and reliable temperature conversions.
Handle invalid input and provide error messages accordingly.
